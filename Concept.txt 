Lesson 5.3: Base Case and Recursive Case in Recursion

Concept Overview:
In Lesson 5.2, we discussed recursive function calls and the call stack. In this lesson, we'll explore two critical 
aspects of recursion: the base case and the recursive case. These are fundamental elements of recursive algorithms that 
determine when the recursion should stop and what action to take in each step.

Key Terminology:
Base case
Recursive case
Termination condition
Recursive algorithm
